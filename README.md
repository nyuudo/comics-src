### Discover new comics and directly support the authors who make it.

An app project **on the works** for reading and sharing independent [webcomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcomic) and hopefully a marketplace to purchase independent printed comics directly from the authors.

## Description

Following my deep interest in the sub-culture of comics I developed this project as an attempt to provide a tool easy to use for artists and comic enthusiasts where they can publish and manage web oriented comics and also traditional printed comic works.

Based partially in commercially available services but focused on independent comics.

Every aspect of this project was partially developed as a way to explore the syntax of modern frameworks based on javascript.

### Disclaimer

This is indeed a work in progress.
The functionalities are being build up step by step with many changes still on development by an indivdual effort on free time. **Any collaboration is welcomed**.

This project aknowledges the **misleading** and **harmful** ransack to the original artworks of many authors by **digital tools** such as **LLMs** that could scan copyright images. Currently there's **no feature** in the logic inside in order to protect any of the images uploaded.

So I strongly recommend the use of [GLAZE](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu), [NightShade](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html), [WebGlaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/webglaze.html) or [MIST](https://github.com/psyker-team/mist), indepentdently or combined. All of them will help you to add some form of **digital cloak,** and circumvent the uncredited/unsolicited art mimicri from generative artificial intelligence prompts.
